# Wordle
My own wordle game created from scratch using the Java Swing library to create an interactive GUI and playable game

Feel free to use the code or project to play or add to the code, or even take inspiration for building your own game.

The main project folder, CTIS210FinalProject, is the project taken directly from netBeans, and contains all the project files.

I also included a .zip file if someone wants to download the project

JAR file now avalible if someone wants to run the game with downloading the project files
