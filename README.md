# Wordle
My own wordle game created from scratch using the Java Swing library to create an interactive GUI and playable game

Feel free to use the code or project to play or add to the code, or even take inspiration for building your own game.

The src project folder holds the source code and other files used in the project if you would like to look at how it was coded

I also included a .zip file if someone wants to download the project

JAR file now avalible if someone wants to run the game without downloading the project files
